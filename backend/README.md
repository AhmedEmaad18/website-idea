## Features

- User inputs a website idea via a form.
- Backend API generates 3 dummy sections (e.g., \"Hero\", \"About\", \"Contact\").
- Sections are stored in MongoDB.
- Frontend fetches and displays sections as a preview.
- Loading indicators and error alerts enhance UX.
- Accessible and responsive design.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js, React
- **Backend:** NestJS, TypeScript
- **Database:** MongoDB (using Mongoose)
- **Styling:** Bootstrap 5, CSS animations

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+ recommended)
- MongoDB running locally or MongoDB Atlas connection URI

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend folder:

   \`\`\`bash
   cd backend
   \`\`\`

2. Install dependencies:

   \`\`\`bash
   npm install
   \`\`\`

3. Configure MongoDB connection:

   - Create a \`.env\` file in the backend root.
   - Add the following:

     \`\`\`
     MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/nest
     PORT=3000
     \`\`\`

   Replace the URI with your MongoDB connection string if using Atlas.

4. Start the NestJS server:

   \`\`\`bash
   npm run start:dev
   \`\`\`

   Backend API will be running at \`http://localhost:3000\`.

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend folder:

   \`\`\`bash
   cd frontend
   \`\`\`

2. Install dependencies:

   \`\`\`bash
   npm install
   \`\`\`

3. Start the Next.js development server:

   \`\`\`bash
   npm run dev
   \`\`\`

   Frontend will be available at \`http://localhost:3001\` (or default port).

## Usage

- Open the frontend in your browser.
- Enter a website idea in the input field and submit.
- Wait for the sections to generate (loading spinner appears).
- Preview the generated sections below the form.
- If an error occurs or input is invalid, an error message is shown.

## Notes

- This project uses dummy static sections for demonstration.
- CORS is configured in the backend for local frontend requests.
- Basic validation and error handling are implemented.
- Animations and ARIA attributes improve UX and accessibility.

---

## Future Improvements

- Add filtering to fetch sections by idea.
- Implement user authentication and idea management.
- Add unit and integration tests.
- Deploy to cloud provider with environment configurations.
- Improve UI with more detailed and dynamic sections.
